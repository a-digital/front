/**
 * Front plugin for Craft CMS
 *
 * Front_Cp Controller
 *
 * --snip--
 * Generally speaking, controllers are the middlemen between the front end of the CP/website and your plugin’s
 * services. They contain action methods which handle individual tasks.
 *
 * A common pattern used throughout Craft involves a controller action gathering post data, saving it on a model,
 * passing the model off to a service, and then responding to the request appropriately depending on the service
 * method’s response.
 *
 * Action methods begin with the prefix “action”, followed by a description of what the method does (for example,
 * actionSaveIngredient()).
